// Oh boy this is gonna be fun
// Here's the workflow:
// 1.- The client makes a Job request.
// 2.- The server receives the request, returns a Job ID.
// 3.- The client builds an object with the Job ID and the request info. Saves it to localStorage
// 4.- The client queries the requested job through a SSE endpoint.
// 5.- The server responds to the SSE endpoint with the Job result if able.
// 6.- The client, if it gets the result, sends another query to the server to mark the job as complete.
// 7.- If the client queries the same job again (which it can check because it's in localStorage), rather than requesting another job, it will get the previous one
// 8.- For ease of use, this should be a library, npm let's fucking do it
